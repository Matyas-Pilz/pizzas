Pizzas and cakes:
  Contain code, base mesh and base texture. Some first pizzas are in https://content.luanti.org/packages/MatyasP/pizzas_pack1/.
  Contain 8 colors of baking level - repaintable with "Repainter D" from my mod repainter (see https://content.luanti.org/packages/MatyasP/repainter/)
  Rotatable both with "Rotator D" from repainter and with //param2 <> from worldedit.

License:
  Palette is under the CC0. Code is under the MIT License.
  Base texture and model are under the CC-BY 4.0.

File "crafting.lua" isn't actually used and is empty because crafting will be added in the future.

Actually isn't supported baking and eating of pizzas, cakes or other circle food. It could be in future. Planned is too "bake level tool".

Creating own pizzas are simple: download both pizzas and pizzas_pack1, copy and edit texture in pizzas_pack1, edit file "pizzas.lua" in pizzas_pack1 and save it.
  It is very simple :)
  When do you want to share your pizzas as mod, please, do not it as pull request but:
  create it as your own mod pizzas_* and to end of your pizzas names add your name/initials (for not duplication of pizza name).
